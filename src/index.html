                Following our project proposal, I had a clear vision for what a successful product could look like.
                Motivated by this vision I took the initiative and took on the role as leader,
                hoping to keep everyone organised and synchronised with each other to build this successful product.
                <br>
                <br>
                Initially, I took on the role task delegation. I developed a Gantt Chart that outlined the entire production timeline of Meal Mate,
                indicating the start and completion date for each feature.
                This required me to assess ethe skills and weaknesses of the team members, ensuring that tasks were assigned effectively.
                The aim was high quality and timely completion of tasks.
                <br>
                <br>
                I proposed using the Django framework, and took the lead in setting up the project's foundations and uploaded
                it to GitHub so the team could begin development. The project also required a database, I utilised Docker to set up a
                container for local testing and integrated it successfully with Django. I created a document so everyone could set up this container.
                <br>
                <br>
                Communication was also highly encouraged and I often checked on my teammates, seeing their progress on tasks and offering help if needed.
